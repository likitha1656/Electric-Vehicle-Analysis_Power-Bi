# Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard - Power BI Project üöó‚ö°

## **Problem Statement**  
As the world shifts towards sustainable transportation, it's critical to understand the **adoption patterns** of electric vehicles (EVs), including **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** and **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**. This dashboard analyzes EV distribution across states, tracks growth trends over the years, and evaluates vehicle eligibility for **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV)** incentives. The insights help policymakers, manufacturers, and consumers make **data-driven decisions** in promoting EV adoption.

---

## **Objectives**  
- Visualize the **state-wise distribution** of BEVs and PHEVs.  
- Track the **growth of EV adoption** over the years.  
- Identify the **top-performing manufacturers** and models in the EV space.  
- Assess the **CAFV eligibility** status of vehicles.

---

## **Key Metrics (KPIs)**  
- **Total Vehicles** ‚Äì Total number of electric vehicles analyzed.  
- **Average Electric Range (in km)** ‚Äì The average driving range of EVs.  
- **BEV %** ‚Äì Percentage of Battery Electric Vehicles in the dataset.  
- **PHEV %** ‚Äì Percentage of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles in the dataset.
